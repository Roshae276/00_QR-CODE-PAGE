# 📱 QR Code Component Page

Hey!  
This is a basic QR code card project I made using HTML and CSS. I followed a design from Frontend Mentor to practice layout, alignment, and styling. It's a very beginner-level project but helped me a lot with structure and spacing in CSS.

## ✍️ Why I made this

I wanted to practice basic layout skills like centering a card, setting widths, using `rem` units, and making responsive UIs. This was one of the first UI components I built and it gave me confidence to try more.
